To compile the rules and generate the final FSTs, just run ./make.sh. The
exported FSTs are defined in the grammar file g2p.grm. The two FST files
G2P1 and G2P2 are defined for being used with python transcriber script.
They are split in two parts to minimize size on disk, but you may just
export a single FST file, if you wish.

After succesful compilation, you might test the rules using either:

- tester.sh: a very simple interactive loop. Just write in or paste the
  words/sentences you want to test.

- transcribe.sh: which will transcribe a file with words or sentences
  given as input.

Thanks:

The implementation of the rules would not have been possible without the
Russian language advice from my colleague at Yandex Anastasiya Polkanova.
