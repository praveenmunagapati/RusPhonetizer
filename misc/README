Before compiling the Thrax package (http://openfst.cs.nyu.edu/twiki/bin/view/GRM/Thrax),
you need to apply the patch file parser.yy.patch to the following file in the Thrax
original source code distribution:

/thrax-1.0.2/src/lib/main/parser.yy

Like this:

patch parser.yy parser.yy.patch

The patch is required to interpret the strings in the grammar files as UTF-8 encoded
(default is otherwise BYTE).

Depending on the compiler's version or OS you are using, you might get some issues when
trying to compile the program thraxcompiler. My experience is that this can be solved changing
the order in which the libraries are passed to the compiler.
