RusPhonetizer is a set of grammar rules and dictionaries for the phonetic transcription of Russian sentences.

This is still work in progress. Especially, a script for wrapping up the functionality and documentation are still missing. Please, be patient. However, the main core - the grammar files with the FST rules for transcription -  are already here. I consider them to be the most valuable part of the whole package.

Updates will follow soon.
