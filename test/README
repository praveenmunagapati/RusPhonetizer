This directory contains the following files:

- rus_sentences.txt: 173 Russian sentences to test the transcriber output.
- rus_sentences.txt.g2p: the phonetic transcription of all 173 sentences.
- rus_sentences.txt.log: transcription log for every sentence, for debugging purposes.

The log file contains the following information (in this order):

    [SNUM]: sentence number. It should correlate with the line number of previous file.
            Useful to quickly locate any sentence.
    [SENT]: the original sentence.
    [YOWR]: a word in the sentence was reconstructed as having a yo letter
    [NORM]: the normalized sentence (currently only case normalization and separation
            of punctuation symbols).
    [WORD]: the word being processed.
    [POSP]: POS prediction output for the word if available.

    One of the following:

        [DISA]: if the word was found in the homographs list. Values here can be:
            * morpho-syntactic tags that were used for the disambiguation.
            * "SINGLETON": the word is not really an homograph (only one unique
              transcription found).
            * "LEX1": no disambiguation possible, entry marked by LEX1 was chosen.
            * "FREQ": no LEX information, the most frequent variant was chosen
              (or the first one, if all were equally frequent).
        [INFO]: word was not found in the homograph list. Possible values:
            * "entry found in user lexicon".
            * "entry found in lexicon".
            * "stress predicted".
        [STRS]: predicted string with stress information, if the word was not found in
                any dictionary.

    [SPHO]: phonetic transcription for the whole sentence after applying cross-word
            assimilations.

Notes/disclaimer:

- The output files (g2p and log) are kept here for information purposes only. More
  specifically, you should not expect to get the same results if you run the
  transcriber on the input sentences. The final output will heavily depend on the
  actual stress prediction model that you use. It can depend also on the version of
  the software packages on which the transcription process depend.

- The transcriptions in rus_sentences.txt.g2p are not guaranteed to be correct.
  Actually, the contrary is the case: since the version of the transcriber uploaded
  to GitHub does not contain any POS prediction software many of the words whose
  pronunciation depend on their function in the sentence will not be predicted
  correctly.

Thanks:

The test sentences were carefully selected by my colleague at Yandex Anastasiya
Polkanova. They were used to assess the quality of the TTS transcriber.
